				PXDMCP

This is the README file for PXDMCP, an XDMCP standalone client that
can be used to request an X11 Display Manager (XDM, GDM, CDE dtlogin etc)
to start a new terminal session (normally used to bring up a login window)
using the XDMCP protocol. This in effect does the same thing as an X
server does when started with the "-query" argument but can be used in
circumstances where that might be impractical.


WARNING:

  Do NOT simply run the client without directing it
  to the right X server since it by default will try to utilize the
  server pointed out by the DISPLAY variable which normally is your
  current display - then you'll probably find that your desktop has
  been taken over by a remote session or deadlock until you login from
  another computer and kill the xdmcp client!


COMPILATION

Edit the Makefile (probably only need to change the LIBS and XAUTH
definitions) and then compile and build it with "make".


USAGE

The client can be used in various ways, but here's an example using
the Xvnc server:

  # Xvnc :50 -auth /var/tmp/authfile &
  # xdmcp -k2 -v -D`uname -n`:50 -A/var/tmp/authfile xdm-server

By default the client will check the DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment
variables and use those values if you don't supply the -D and -A flags.

If the DISPLAY variable is of the form ":DPY[.SCR]" then the client will
compute a new DISPLAY variable by prepending the official hostname of
the system before submitting this value to the remote XDMCP server.

Please note that this might *not* be the correct value for your application!

If you omit the XDM server argument then it by default will try to contact
an XDM server on the local host.
